I"¬<h2> Physical </h2>

<p>Properties of seawater, it movements, and how ocean waters interact with the atmosphere. 
Sea water- Temperature, density and pressure.
Movements-  Waves, currents, and tides. <br />
    Winds and ocean affect the direction in which the water travels around the rotating Earth. 
    The direction of currents is affected by global wind systems powered by the sun. 
Circulation and climate 
    Ocean circulation is a key point of physical oceanography and the Earthâ€™s climate system. 
    Ocean circulation absorbs solar radiation and transfers it across the ocean to spread warmths
Hazards 
    The ocean is always changing so that could sometimes result in threats to humans. 
    Some examples are earthquakes, tsunamis, and hurricanes.</p>
